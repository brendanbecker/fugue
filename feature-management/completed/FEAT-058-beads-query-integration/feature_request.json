  "description": "Add beads query integration to fugue's TUI, providing visibility into the beads work queue directly in the terminal multiplexer interface. Can use FEAT-050 metadata to cache daemon state (beads.ready_count, beads.daemon_available). Can use FEAT-028 tag-based routing to notify orchestrators of state changes.",

  "technical_complexity": "medium",
  "user_impact": "Provides at-a-glance work queue visibility without context switching. Users can see pending tasks, daemon health, and quickly navigate to work items."
