  "description": "Add a user priority lockout system that prevents MCP focus operations (fugue_focus_pane, fugue_select_window, fugue_select_session) from conflicting with user keyboard commands. When a user enters command mode (prefix key like Ctrl+B), the server should temporarily block or defer MCP focus-changing operations until the user completes their command or the timeout expires.",
  "business_value": "medium",
  "technical_complexity": "medium",
  "user_impact": "Prevents frustrating UX where MCP agents 'fight' with users over focus control. Users can reliably navigate without MCP operations unexpectedly changing their view."
