  "description": "High-level MCP tool for executing multiple commands in parallel across separate panes. Returns aggregated results when ALL tasks complete or timeout. Supports tiled layout (visible splits) or hidden mode (separate __orchestration__ session). Maximum 10 parallel tasks. Designed to reduce orchestrator context consumption by eliminating need for manual pane management.",
  "business_value": "high",
  "technical_complexity": "medium",
  "user_impact": "Enables orchestrators to run parallel commands with a single tool call instead of multiple create_pane/send_input/poll cycles. Reduces context usage by 70-80% for parallel workflows. Simplifies multi-agent coordination patterns."
