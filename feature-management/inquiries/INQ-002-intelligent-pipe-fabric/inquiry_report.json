  "question": "How can fugue evolve from a terminal multiplexer into a distributed intelligent stream processing fabric, replacing Unix pipes with remote-capable, agent-aware, observable data flows?",
  "context": "Unix pipes are the right abstraction but limited to local, synchronous, dumb byte streams. fugue already has primitives (panes, send_input/read_pane, orchestration, run_parallel/pipeline) that could enable distributed intelligent streaming. The vision is 'replace | with mux' - seamless pipe-pane usage as native remote compute.",
  "constraints": [
    "Must feel as natural as Unix pipes",
    "Must work with existing fugue primitives",
    "Must support both agents and shell commands as targets",
    "Must not break existing functionality"
