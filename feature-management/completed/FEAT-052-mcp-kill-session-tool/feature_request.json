  "description": "Expose the existing DestroySession protocol message as an MCP tool so agents can terminate sessions programmatically. This enables orchestration patterns like Gas Town's worker management, which currently uses tmux kill-session. The capability already exists in the daemon via ClientMessage::DestroySession { session_id: Uuid } but is not exposed via MCP.",
