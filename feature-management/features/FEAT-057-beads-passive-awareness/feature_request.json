  "description": "Add passive beads awareness to ccmux that automatically detects when panes are operating in beads-tracked repositories and configures them appropriately. Currently, using beads with ccmux requires manual configuration of environment variables (BEADS_DIR, BEADS_NO_DAEMON) for each session/pane. This is error-prone and tedious, especially in multi-agent workflows where many panes are created dynamically.",
