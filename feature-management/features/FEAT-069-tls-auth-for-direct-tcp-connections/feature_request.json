  "description": "Add native TLS encryption and authentication for direct TCP connections, eliminating the need for SSH tunnels in trusted network environments. This is Phase 4 (future enhancement) of remote peering support. While SSH tunnels (FEAT-068) provide secure remote access, they require SSH setup and add a layer of indirection. In some environments (e.g., trusted LANs, VPNs), users may prefer direct TLS connections. This requires implementing TLS using rustls and a simple authentication mechanism.",
  "business_value": "medium",
  "technical_complexity": "high",
  "user_impact": "Provides an alternative to SSH tunnels for users in trusted network environments who prefer direct TLS connections. Simplifies setup in VPN/LAN scenarios while maintaining security through TLS encryption and shared-secret authentication. Optional feature for advanced use cases."
