  "description": "Add deep workflow integration between ccmux panes and beads issues, enabling automatic correlation, audit trails, and recovery hints for multi-agent development workflows. This includes pane-issue assignment tracking, auto-injection of pane context into beads operations, issue creation from pane events, recovery/query tools, and orchestration integration.",
  "business_value": "high",
  "technical_complexity": "high",
  "user_impact": "Provides complete audit trail of pane-issue work, easy debugging (what was pane X working on when it crashed), recovery support (restart work on issue Y), and accurate attribution (which pane/session completed each task)."
