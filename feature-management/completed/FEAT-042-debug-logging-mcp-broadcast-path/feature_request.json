  "description": "Add comprehensive debug logging throughout the MCP pane creation and broadcast path to diagnose BUG-010. The TUI never receives PaneCreated broadcasts from MCP-created panes, and we need to trace where messages get lost in the message flow from handler to registry to client connection to TUI app.",

  "technical_complexity": "low",
  "user_impact": "Enables diagnosis of BUG-010 which prevents MCP-created panes from appearing in TUI. Critical for unblocking the MCP pane creation feature."
