  "description": "Replace methodology-specific orchestration concepts with generic primitives so fugue can support any workflow (Context Engineering, Gas Town, custom) rather than hardcoding a specific coordination pattern. Make fugue a 'dumb pipe' that handles session lifecycle and message routing with arbitrary metadata, letting users define workflow semantics.",

  "technical_complexity": "medium",
  "user_impact": "Enables fugue to support arbitrary multi-agent workflows without protocol changes, increasing flexibility and adoption potential across different orchestration methodologies"
