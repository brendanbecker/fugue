  "description": "Implement split pane rendering in the fugue client so that when a pane is split, both panes are displayed side-by-side (or stacked) rather than requiring manual switching with Ctrl+B o. Currently the client receives PaneCreated messages and stores pane data, but draw_attached() only renders the active_pane_id.",
  "business_value": "high",
  "technical_complexity": "medium",
  "user_impact": "Essential tmux-like UX where split panes are immediately visible. Without this, splits are confusing because users can't see their results."
