  "description": "When panes are created via MCP (e.g., fugue_create_pane tool), TUI clients don't see the split because the server doesn't broadcast the PaneCreated message to them. The MCP bridge's handle_create_pane_with_options returns HandlerResult::Response instead of HandlerResult::ResponseWithBroadcast, causing only the MCP client to receive the response while TUI clients remain unaware of the new pane.",
  "business_value": "high",
  "technical_complexity": "low",
  "user_impact": "Essential for MCP-TUI interoperability. Without this fix, users must manually refresh or reconnect TUI clients after MCP creates panes, breaking the seamless multi-client experience."
