  "description": "Implement proper text selection within copy mode that respects pane boundaries. Currently, shift+click text selection is handled by the terminal emulator, which doesn't know about ccmux pane boundaries, resulting in selection spanning across panes or including border characters. This feature adds vim-style keyboard selection (v/V for visual modes), mouse drag selection clipped to pane bounds, visual highlighting of selected text, and clipboard integration via OSC 52 escape sequences.",
  "business_value": "high",
  "technical_complexity": "medium",
  "user_impact": "Enables users to select and copy text from terminal panes without accidentally selecting content from adjacent panes or border characters, matching expectations from tmux copy mode"
