## Status Update

BUG-069 investigation complete. Root cause identified:

**Problem**: Messages delivered to wrong session due to `attached_session` fallback in poll_messages handler.

**Fix**: Made `worker_id` parameter optional. When omitted, uses the caller's attached session. When provided, validates caller has permission to poll that session.

**Changes**:
- `fugue-server/src/mcp/bridge/handlers.rs:412-445`
- Added unit tests for both cases

Ready for review and merge.
