  "description": "The MCP bridge handler implementation (fugue-server/src/handlers/mcp_bridge.rs) has grown to 2591 lines (~27k tokens) and exceeds the practical context window limit for AI-assisted development. This is the handler layer that dispatches MCP tool calls to session/pane operations. It needs to be refactored into smaller, more maintainable modules with clear separation of tool categories.",
  "business_value": "high",
  "technical_complexity": "medium",
  "user_impact": "Improved code maintainability and testability. Easier navigation and modification of MCP tool handlers. Better AI assistant support for targeted code changes."
