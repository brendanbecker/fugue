  "description": "Allow panes to specify custom Claude Code configuration on spawn, including model selection, context limits, and other Claude settings. This enables fine-grained control over Claude instances per-pane, supporting use cases like mixed Haiku/Sonnet/Opus agents, custom context limits, and specialized configurations.",
  "business_value": "high",
  "technical_complexity": "medium",
  "user_impact": "Enables cost optimization (Haiku for simple tasks), specialized agents (Opus for architecture), and flexible multi-agent workflows. Users can create heterogeneous agent configurations within a single ccmux session."
