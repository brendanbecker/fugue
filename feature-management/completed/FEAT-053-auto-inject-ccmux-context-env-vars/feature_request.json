  "description": "When spawning any pane, automatically inject environment variables that identify the ccmux context: CCMUX_PANE_ID (UUID of the pane), CCMUX_SESSION_ID (UUID of the session), CCMUX_WINDOW_ID (UUID of the window), and CCMUX_SESSION_NAME (human-readable session name). This enables Claude Code instances and other processes to be self-aware of their ccmux context without requiring explicit configuration.",
  "business_value": "high",
  "technical_complexity": "low",
  "user_impact": "Enables Claude Code instances to identify which pane they're running in, use MCP tools on themselves, and coordinate with other Claude instances across panes"
