  "description": "Add MCP tools for explicit focus/selection control: ccmux_select_pane, ccmux_select_window, ccmux_select_session. Also change ccmux_create_pane to NOT auto-switch focus by default, with an optional 'select' parameter to opt-in.",

  "technical_complexity": "low",
  "user_impact": "Enables LLMs to control terminal navigation explicitly, and prevents unwanted focus switches when creating panes programmatically. Critical for multi-pane orchestration workflows."
