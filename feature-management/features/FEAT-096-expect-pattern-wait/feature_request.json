  "description": "High-level MCP tool that blocks until a regex pattern appears in pane output or timeout occurs. Supports configurable actions on match: notify, close_pane, or return_output. Uses polling-based implementation with 200ms interval. Foundation primitive for FEAT-094 and FEAT-095.",
  "business_value": "high",
  "technical_complexity": "low",
  "user_impact": "Enables efficient waiting for specific output patterns without manual polling loops. Reduces context consumption by replacing read_pane polling cycles with single blocking call. Provides automatic actions on pattern match (close pane, return output)."
