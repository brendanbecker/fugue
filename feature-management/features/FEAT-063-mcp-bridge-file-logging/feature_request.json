  "description": "The MCP bridge (ccmux-server mcp-bridge) currently skips logging initialization entirely because it uses stdio for JSON-RPC. This means all tracing calls (debug!, info!, error!) in bridge.rs go nowhere, making it impossible to debug issues like BUG-039 (MCP tools hanging). File-based logging does NOT interfere with stdio JSON-RPC protocol and should be enabled for the mcp-bridge mode.",

  "technical_complexity": "low",
  "user_impact": "Critical for debugging MCP bridge issues like BUG-039. Currently zero visibility into bridge behavior."
