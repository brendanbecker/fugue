  "description": "Add beads query integration to ccmux's TUI, providing visibility into the beads work queue directly in the terminal multiplexer interface. When working in beads-tracked repositories, users and agents must shell out to `bd ready`, `bd list`, etc. to see the work queue. This feature provides at-a-glance visibility into pending tasks without context switching.",
