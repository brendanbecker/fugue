  "description": "Panes should not be tightly coupled to PTY sessions. Design for multiple content types using a PaneContent enum that supports Terminal (PTY + vt100 parser + buffer) and Canvas (structured interactive widget) variants. This enables spawning rich interactive views like diff viewers and test results viewers via sideband commands.",

  "technical_complexity": "high",
  "user_impact": "Enables rich interactive content beyond terminal output, allowing Claude Code to spawn structured widgets like diff viewers and test result displays for improved developer experience."
