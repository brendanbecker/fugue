  "description": "High-level MCP tool for executing commands sequentially within a single pane. Supports stop_on_error mode to halt pipeline immediately on failure. Returns exit codes per step plus pane_id for output inspection. Designed to reduce orchestrator context consumption for multi-step workflows.",
  "business_value": "high",
  "technical_complexity": "medium",
  "user_impact": "Enables orchestrators to run command sequences (build/test/deploy) with a single tool call. Automatic error handling with stop_on_error. Reduces context by eliminating per-step send_input/wait cycles. Provides structured results for each pipeline stage."
