  "description": "The ccmux TUI can become corrupted with overlapping/garbled content, especially during rapid status line updates, terminal resize events, session/window switching, and pane output containing escape sequences that are not fully processed. Add a keybinding to force a complete screen redraw that clears the terminal, re-renders all pane borders and status bars, re-renders pane contents from the terminal buffer, and resets any corrupted terminal state.",
  "business_value": "medium",
  "technical_complexity": "low",
  "user_impact": "Provides users a quick recovery mechanism when display corruption occurs, instead of having to resize the terminal window as a workaround"
