  "description": "A pane that renders another pane's output in real-time, allowing visibility into other sessions without switching context. Enables 'plate spinning' visibility - monitor multiple agents simultaneously without losing your place. Mirror pane is read-only, updates in real-time as source produces output, and maintains independent scrollback from the source pane.",

  "user_impact": "Enables orchestrator sessions to monitor worker output in real-time without context switching, dramatically improving multi-agent workflow visibility and reducing the need to constantly flip between panes/sessions"
