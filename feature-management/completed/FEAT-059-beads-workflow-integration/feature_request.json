  "description": "Add deep workflow integration between fugue panes and beads issues. SCOPE REDUCED: FEAT-050 metadata storage provides foundation for pane-issue correlation (beads.current_issue, beads.assigned_at, beads.issue_history). FEAT-028 tag-based routing enables orchestration notifications. Focus now on convenience wrappers and crash handling rather than new infrastructure.",
  "business_value": "high",
  "technical_complexity": "medium",
  "user_impact": "Provides complete audit trail of pane-issue work, easy debugging (what was pane X working on when it crashed), recovery support (restart work on issue Y), and accurate attribution (which pane/session completed each task)."
