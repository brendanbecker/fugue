  "description": "Add MCP tools for the tag-based orchestration protocol, enabling agents to communicate directly without going through shell commands. This exposes the generic OrchestrationMessage (msg_type + payload) and tag-based OrchestrationTarget types as first-class MCP tools. Also includes tag management tools (fugue_set_tags, fugue_get_tags) for session classification.",

  "technical_complexity": "medium",
  "user_impact": "Agents become first-class participants in orchestration rather than passive recipients of nudges. This is the 'Orchestrator API Surface' that enables true agent-to-agent coordination."
