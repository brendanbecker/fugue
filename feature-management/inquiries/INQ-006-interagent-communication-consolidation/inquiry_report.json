  "question": "How should fugue consolidate its multiple inter-agent communication mechanisms into a reliable, coherent system?",
  "context": "fugue has accumulated multiple overlapping mechanisms for agent-to-agent communication (send_orchestration, report_status, request_help, poll_messages, broadcast, tag routing, watchdog timer). None are end-to-end reliable - BUG-069 shows messages claiming delivery but never being received. The mental model is unclear and documentation describes patterns that don't work.",
  "constraints": [
    "Must work reliably - no false success responses",
    "Must be testable - integration tests proving end-to-end flow",
    "Must be simple - clear mental model for usage",
    "Backward compatible - existing tools work or have migration path",
    "Low latency for real-time orchestration"
