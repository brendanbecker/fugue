  "description": "Add per-pane MCP mode control to reduce token overhead in worker panes. This builds on FEAT-071 (per-pane Claude config) to specifically address MCP server loading, providing dramatic token savings (5k-50k+ per worker) by controlling which MCP servers/tools are available per pane. Claude Code loads all active MCP servers + tools into context at session start, even if unused. In multi-agent swarms (gastown polecats), this bloats every worker's context window with unnecessary tools. Workers rarely need advanced tools like GitHub, Playwright, etc.",

  "user_impact": "Enables dramatic token savings (5k-50k+ per worker pane) in multi-agent workflows. For 10 worker panes, saves 50k-500k tokens per session. Workers start faster with reduced MCP overhead. Reduces hallucinated tool use in workers. Supports cost optimization by limiting tool availability to what's actually needed per pane."
