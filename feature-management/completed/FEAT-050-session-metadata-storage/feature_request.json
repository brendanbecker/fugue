  "description": "Allow storing arbitrary key-value metadata on sessions to track agent identity, role, and other workflow-specific information. Gas Town tracks agent identity via session naming convention (gt-<rig>-<agent>) and environment variables. Identity includes: Role (mayor/deacon/witness/refinery/crew/polecat), Rig name, Agent name. This metadata should be queryable without parsing session names.",

  "user_impact": "Enables cleaner agent identity tracking and session queries for multi-agent orchestration workflows like Gas Town"
