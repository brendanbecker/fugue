  "description": "The fugue_create_pane MCP tool lacks explicit session and window targeting parameters. While handle_create_pane_with_options already supports session_filter and window_filter parameters, the MCP bridge hardcodes these to None, always using the 'first session' heuristic. This prevents Claude from orchestrating panes across multiple sessions.",
  "business_value": "high",
  "technical_complexity": "low",
  "user_impact": "Enables Claude to orchestrate panes across multiple sessions (e.g., 'create a new session in the background, launch 4 panes each with a relevant command'). Essential for reliable multi-session workflows."
