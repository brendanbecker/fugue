  "description": "Add optional TCP listener support to the fugue daemon, enabling network-based client connections. This is Phase 1 of remote peering support, allowing the daemon to accept connections over TCP in addition to the default Unix socket. Currently, fugue daemon only accepts connections via Unix domain socket (~/.fugue/fugue.sock), which limits client connections to the local machine. To support remote workflows (e.g., Mayor on laptop controlling polecats on gaming PC), the daemon needs optional TCP listener capability.",
  "business_value": "high",
  "technical_complexity": "medium",
  "user_impact": "Enables remote workflows and cross-machine fugue control via TCP connections. Critical building block for SSH tunnel-based remote peering, allowing users to manage fugue sessions across different machines securely."
